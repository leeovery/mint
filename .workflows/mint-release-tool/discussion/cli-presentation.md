# Discussion: CLI Presentation

## Context

`mint` is the reusable Go release tool extracted from per-project bash release scripts (see the decided `mint-release-tool` topic). This discussion covers its **presentation layer** — the styled-but-restrained UI applied consistently across *every* verb (`release`, `regenerate`, `init`, `version`, and the future `commit`), not only the release run.

The shape settled in discovery:

- **Interactive terminal**: brand + title, colour, and progress spinners while git and the `claude` CLI work.
- **Non-TTY (piped/redirected)**: degrades to token-efficient plain text, so an AI or agent consuming the output isn't paying for ANSI noise.
- **Detection**: render mode is driven by **TTY detection**, not environment sniffing.
- **`-y`/`--yes` is orthogonal**: it only skips interactive gate stops. A human at a terminal with `-y` still gets the styled UI.
- **Open how-question** (deferred to later phases): which Go packages provide styling and spinners — a charm/lipgloss-style stack vs lighter colour libraries.

## Render-Mode Detection Model

### Context

The seed mandates: render mode is driven by **TTY detection, not environment sniffing**. Interactive terminal → styled (brand, colour, spinners); non-TTY (an AI/agent consuming the output) → token-efficient plain text. The job here was to make "TTY detection" operationally precise, since `mint` is a **local interactive tool, not a CI job**, and `mint release` emits no capturable data payload — its output *is* the run narration.

### Decision (REVISED — grounded in the sibling `tick` tool's proven model)

**Two modes only — `pretty` + `plain`.** No structured (`json`/`toon`) mode: `tick` has one because it renders *data structures* (task lists); mint renders a *process*, so an agent reads the narration, it doesn't parse it. Structured output is YAGNI, addable later.
- **`pretty`** (human): brand, colour, spinners, formatted stages.
- **`plain`** (agent): terse token-efficient text — no ANSI, no animation, no banner.

**Detection — `isatty(stdout)` only. No override flags, no sniffing:**
- `isatty(stdout)` → `pretty`; non-TTY → `plain`. That is the *entire* mechanism — there is **no `--pretty`/`--plain`/`--no-color` override**. (The only run flag near this area is `-y`, which is gating, not rendering — orthogonal.)
- **"Human vs agent" reduces to "is stdout a terminal?"** — exactly `tick`'s mechanism (`stat(stdout).Mode() & os.ModeCharDevice != 0` on `os.Stdout`). An agent never announces itself; its harness captures stdout through a **pipe** (not a char device) → `false` → plain. A human's terminal is a char device → `true` → pretty. Same binary, same path; the OS reports what's connected for free. mint mirrors this (the stat check, or `term.IsTerminal(int(os.Stdout.Fd()))`).
- **No `CI=true`/`TERM` guessing** — the environment sniffing the seed forbids.
- **The two edge cases are features, not compromises** (confirmed desirable by the user): a human who pipes/redirects (`mint … > out.txt`, `… | grep`) gets `plain` — exactly what you want when capturing output (no ANSI junk), and this *is* the "force plain" path. An agent on a pseudo-terminal getting `pretty` is rare and harmless. There is deliberately no force-pretty.

**Stream split — narration is the product, so it's stdout:**
- **Run narration → stdout** — stages, the plan, the notes preview, the final summary, and `mint version`'s value. mint has no separate data payload, so the narration *is* its stdout output.
- **Errors + warnings → stderr** — the one real job stderr keeps: *visibility under redirection*. `mint release > run.log` sends stdout to the file, but a failure on stderr still hits the terminal and can't silently vanish.
- **Exit code** signals success/failure for scripts (they check `$?`, not stream parsing).
- An **agent captures combined output (`2>&1`)** by default, so it sees narration *and* errors regardless of the split — the split costs the agent nothing and buys humans redirect-visibility.

**No colour flag.** Colour is intrinsic to `pretty` and absent from `plain` — there is no `--no-color` and no `NO_COLOR` handling. Don't want colour? Pipe/redirect the output — any non-terminal stdout gives `plain`. Mode ∈ {pretty, plain}, full stop — no third "no-colour-but-styled" state, and no render-mode flags at all. (`NO_COLOR` support is addable later if anyone ever asks; YAGNI now.)

### Journey

Three course-corrections, each from the user:

1. **Initial framing assumed a payload-vs-chrome stdout/stderr split** where a human might do `mint release > notes.txt`. Wrong — mint emits no capturable release payload; it performs side effects and shows the notes-review gate interactively.
2. **First revision over-corrected to "all chrome → stderr, detect on stderr."** The review (F8) caught the tension: if everything meaningful is on stderr and stdout is empty, an agent capturing stdout gets near-silence.
3. **Resolved by reading `tick`** (the user's sibling CLI, which they already trust): it treats its rendered output as the product → **stdout**, detects on stdout, and reserves stderr for errors/`--verbose`. mint adopts the same stance. The "git/wget put progress on stderr" pattern exists to protect a *real* stdout payload mint doesn't have — copying it would be cargo-culting.

The model collapsed to: **one logical output, rendered by an adapter chosen by audience (auto via stdout TTY, override via flag); narration→stdout, errors→stderr.**

Confidence: high.

## -y/--yes Orthogonality

### Context

The seed: `-y/--yes` is orthogonal to styling — it only skips interactive gate stops; a human at a terminal with `-y` still gets the styled UI. Three independent concerns: **styling** (TTY), **gating** (`-y`), **output stream** (stdout/stderr).

### Decided so far

- **Three orthogonal axes**: styling = f(TTY), gating = f(`-y`), output stream = fixed (chrome→stderr, payload→stdout). A human with `-y` at a terminal still gets full styling.
- **The one forbidden combination errors, never hangs**: if **stdin is not a TTY** and **`-y` was not passed**, the notes-review gate (`[a]/[e]/[r]/[q]`) can't be answered — mint **fails loud** ("not a TTY — pass `-y` to run unattended") rather than blocking on stdin. Render mode is about *output* (stderr TTY); the gate is about *input* (stdin TTY) — both checked independently.

Still exploring: whether any other gates exist beyond notes-review that interact with `-y`.

## Presentation Seam / Architecture

### Context

The structural backbone the topic exists to define: how the engine and the presentation layer relate, so that mode selection, colour, and spinners live in exactly one place and the seven-stage release spine stays oblivious to them. `tick` gave a template — a `Formatter` interface with concrete per-mode impls behind a factory — but `tick`'s methods are **data-shaped** (`FormatTaskList(tasks)`) because it renders data structures. mint renders a **process**, so the seam must be shaped differently.

### Decision

**An event/step-oriented `Presenter` interface the engine calls at lifecycle points.** The engine emits *semantic events* ("stage X started", "here's the plan", "warn: hook failed"); the presenter decides *how they look*. Illustrative method set (exact surface settled at spec/impl):

```
StageStarted(name) · StageSucceeded(name) · StageFailed(name, err)
Warn(msg) · ShowPlan(plan) · ShowNotes(body) · Prompt(gate) → choice
```

- **Two implementations behind the interface — `pretty` and `plain`** — selected **once at startup** from `isatty(stdout)`. Nothing downstream re-checks the TTY.
- **The engine never touches colour, spinners, or TTY state.** It calls `Presenter` methods only. This mirrors the engine's existing seams (`CommandRunner` for git/gh/claude, `Publisher` for releases) — the same dependency-inversion discipline, now for output.
- **Applies to every verb.** `release`, `regenerate`, `init`, `version` all emit through the same `Presenter`, which is *how* the "consistent presentation across all verbs" goal is met structurally (not per-verb styling code).
- **Testability** (the whole Go rationale): assert which events fired and with what payload, independent of rendering. A `plain` impl is trivially assertable; a fake/recording presenter verifies engine behaviour without parsing styled text.
- **Spinners are a `pretty`-only concern** owned inside the pretty presenter (e.g. a spinner spans the gap between `StageStarted` and `StageSucceeded/Failed`); `plain` renders the same events as terse lines. Lifecycle detail deferred to the spinners subtopic.

### Journey

Considered cloning `tick`'s data-shaped `Formatter` directly, but mint has no task-list-equivalent to format — it has a running process. Reshaping the seam from "format this data" to "react to this event" keeps the decoupling principle (one interface, per-mode impls, factory by mode) while fitting what mint actually does. The engine-emits-events / presenter-renders split is the payoff: the spine is testable and rendering-agnostic.

Confidence: high (on the split and the event shape; exact method signatures are spec/impl detail).

## Library Selection (Charm vs lighter)

### Context

The discovery how-question: which Go packages provide styling and spinners — a charm/lipgloss stack vs lighter colour libs. Grounded by two sibling Go tools the user already runs: `tick` (uses lipgloss-style formatting) and `portal`.

### Decision

- **`lipgloss` for all `pretty`-mode styling** — colour, the 🌿 brand line, status glyphs, the notes box/border. It is *pure string styling* (no event loop), so it composes with the `Presenter` seam, and it auto-downgrades colour when piped. Idiomatic and already in the user's toolchain.
- **A lightweight standalone spinner** for stage progress — `briandowns/spinner` (explicit `Start()`/`Stop()`, maps 1:1 to `StageStarted`/`StageSucceeded`) or charm's `huh/spinner`. Exact pick is an impl detail; the seam doesn't care.
- **NOT Bubble Tea / no alt-screen / no full-screen TUI.** Print-style linear narration only.
- **`plain` mode pulls in no UI library** — just `fmt` lines. That's the point of token-efficiency.

### Journey — why not Bubble Tea / Portal's stack

`portal` is a full-screen Bubble Tea TUI (`tea.NewProgram(tea.WithAltScreen())`, a `Model`/`Update`/`View` state machine with pages and modals). Inspected as a candidate baseline and **rejected for mint**: it's built for an interactive picker that *owns the screen*, whereas mint narrates a linear process and exits. A full TUI would also fight the `Presenter` seam (Bubble Tea wants to own the event loop; mint's engine drives and calls the presenter) and the dual pretty/plain requirement. We take **lipgloss** (the styling layer) from that ecosystem and leave the TUI runtime. Note: `portal` and `tick` both detect TTY with the same `os.Stdout.Stat() & ModeCharDevice` check we locked — three-for-three.

Confidence: high on the stack (lipgloss + standalone spinner, no Bubble Tea); specific spinner package is impl detail.

## What The Pretty Layer Shows / Plain Contract (worked examples)

### Context

The user asked for **concrete logged examples** so the implementer isn't guessing the look-and-feel. Both modes consume the *same* `Presenter` events; only rendering differs. Baseline below — refinable at implementation, but the intent is fixed.

### Baseline renderings (per event)

| Event | `pretty` | `plain` |
|---|---|---|
| start of run | `🌿 mint · {project}  ›  releasing v{X}` brand line | `mint: releasing {project} v{X}` |
| `StageStarted` | dim line with spinner: `⠋ notes  generating with claude…` | (no line until transition) |
| `StageSucceeded` | `✓ {stage}  {detail} ({elapsed})`, glyph green | `{stage}: ok` / `{stage}: {detail}` |
| `StageFailed` | `✗ {stage}  {message}`, glyph red | `{stage}: FAILED - {message}` (also stderr) |
| auto-unwind | `↩ unwound  {what it undid} — repo clean` | `unwound: {what}; repo clean` |
| `Warn` | `⚠ {label}  {message}`, amber | `{label}: WARN - {message}` (also stderr) |
| `ShowPlan` | a `Plan` block, bulleted | `plan: {semicolon-joined one-liner}` |
| `ShowNotes` | rounded box `╭─ Release notes · v{X} ─╮ … ╰─╯` | `--- release notes v{X} ---` … `--- end notes ---` |
| review gate | `[a] accept  [e] edit  [r] regenerate  [q] abort` + `› ` prompt | (not shown — non-TTY ⇒ `-y` required ⇒ gate skipped; emits `notes: accepted (-y)`) |
| end of run | `🌿 released {project} v{X} · {url}` | `done: {project} v{X} {url}` |

### Spinner lifecycle (resolves the spinners subtopic)

- One spinner at a time, on the **current** stage line (stderr-independent — it's part of the narration on stdout). Starts on `StageStarted`, replaced in place by the `✓`/`✗` line on completion. Braille frames (`⠋⠙⠹…`).
- **Underlying command output** (git/claude/gh chatter) is captured by mint, not streamed through the spinner line, so the animation can't be corrupted. On failure mint prints the captured output below the `✗` line.
- **`$EDITOR` (note edit)** takes over the terminal — spinner is stopped before handing off, resumed after.
- **`plain` never animates** — a stage emits exactly one line on its transition.

Confidence: medium-high — baseline agreed in principle; awaiting user confirmation on glyphs / brand line / box style / plain verbosity.

## Summary

### Key Insights

1. **mint's narration IS its output.** No separate data payload (bar `mint version`), so narration → stdout, and stderr is reserved for errors/warnings (kept only for redirect-visibility). "All process" is fine — when the narration is the product, the narration is stdout.
2. **Mirror `tick`'s adapter model** — one logical output, rendered by an adapter chosen by audience: `isatty(stdout)` → pretty, else plain; explicit flag overrides. Proven in a sibling tool the user already trusts.
3. **Two modes suffice** (pretty + plain). Structured json/toon is YAGNI here because mint renders a process, not a queryable data structure.
4. **Three orthogonal axes**: styling (TTY) · gating (`-y`) · output stream. Independence is the design's backbone.
5. **Engine emits events; presenter renders.** An event-oriented `Presenter` seam (not tick's data-shaped `Formatter`) keeps the seven-stage spine oblivious to colour/spinners/TTY — mirroring the `CommandRunner`/`Publisher` seams — and is how "consistent across all verbs" is achieved structurally.
6. **No render-mode flags.** Mode is purely `isatty(stdout)`; piping is the natural "force plain". Minimal surface by design.

### Open Threads

- **Dry-run note reuse / caching** — **routed out** to the `mint-release-tool` discussion (engine/dry-run behaviour, not presentation) as an addendum to its dry-run-semantics decision, so the in-progress spec picks it up. The idea: cache the dry-run-generated note and reuse it on the real run to guarantee *what was previewed is what ships* (determinism), with invalidation keyed on the post-exclude diff + version + prompt. Resolved here; decided in spec.
- Library selection was flagged in discovery as a deferred how-question.

### Current State

- Render-mode detection **decided** (stdout-based, tick-aligned, two modes, narration→stdout, no flags). Presentation seam **decided** (event-oriented `Presenter`, two impls). `-y` orthogonality mostly decided. Remaining: what the pretty layer shows, the concrete plain-mode text contract, spinners, library selection.
