# Discussion: Commit Command

## Context

`mint commit` is a sibling verb to `mint release` — an AI-generated commit message
from the diff, built into the `mint` binary rather than living as a per-machine
shell function. It was **parked in the first discussion** as "its own separate
feature," with the `mint <verb>` namespace adopted precisely to leave room for it;
the pivot of mint from a single feature to an **epic** is the trigger that was
flagged for promoting it. This discussion designs it.

**Shape (from discovery):** the command wraps the user's existing AI-commit shell
function — an AI-generated commit message from the (staged) diff, with `--all`,
`--no-ai`, one-time context injection, and auto-push. "Minting a commit" fits the
brand. The user wants it **built into mint**, sharing:

- **the AI engine** — `claude -p` transport, mint-owned prompt, fail-loud + retry,
  `--no-ai` skip (see the release discussion's *AI release notes — skeleton*);
- **the `.mint.toml` config** — typed, optional, fail-loud (see *Config format & schema*);
- **the styled presentation layer** — the event-oriented `Presenter` seam, `pretty`
  vs `plain` by `isatty(stdout)`/`--plain`, `-y` orthogonality, the review gate
  rendering (see the *cli-presentation* discussion).

The integration details — **how much it reuses the release pipeline versus stands
alone** — were deliberately left for this discussion. That's the framing fork below.

### What's settled elsewhere (not re-litigated here unless commit forces it)

- The `mint <verb>` namespace, the `Presenter` seam + pretty/plain + `--plain`/`-y`,
  the AI-engine skeleton (`ai_command`, prompt-ownership, fail-loud, retry, `--no-ai`),
  lock-resilient git (`git_safe`), and the TOML config model all exist already.
  `commit` *consumes* these; it should not redesign them.

### References

- [mint-release-tool discussion](mint-release-tool.md) — the engine, AI-notes skeleton, config schema, lock-resilient git, lifecycle spine `commit` may or may not reuse
- [cli-presentation discussion](cli-presentation.md) — the `Presenter` seam, pretty/plain, review-gate rendering, `--plain`/`-y` that `commit` inherits
- [Discovery session 002](../discovery/session-002.md) — where `commit` was promoted to its own epic topic

## Discussion Map

### States

- **pending** (`○`) — identified but not yet explored
- **exploring** (`◐`) — actively being discussed
- **converging** (`→`) — narrowing toward a decision
- **decided** (`✓`) — decision reached with rationale documented

### Map

  ┌─ ○ Scope & relationship to the release pipeline (the framing fork) [pending]
  ├─ ○ Commit flow / lifecycle (the stages) [pending]
  ├─ ○ Staging model & `--all` (what gets committed) [pending]
  ├─ ○ AI message generation (engine reuse, diff base) [pending]
  ├─ ○ Commit message format & prompt (conventional vs emoji sections) [pending]

*Subtopics are documented below as they reach `decided` or accumulate enough
exploration to capture. These seeds are a starting point, not a fixed agenda — the
map grows and converges as we go. The framing fork (scope vs the release pipeline)
is the natural place to start, since most other subtopics cascade from it.*
