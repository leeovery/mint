# Epic Research Session

*Reference for **[workflow-research-process](../SKILL.md)***

---

## A. Background Agents

Two types of background agent operate during research, and the topic's triage queue surfaces through a third protocol file. Load their instructions now — they run at the appropriate moments during the session loop.

→ Load **[review-agent.md](review-agent.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Load **[deep-dive-agent.md](deep-dive-agent.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Load **[rerouted-concerns.md](../../workflow-shared/references/rerouted-concerns.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, topic = `{topic}`, phase = `research` — a protocol, not a step: the session loop's triage check enters its **A. Check**; nothing runs at load time.

---

## B. Session Loop

Per-topic session with topic awareness and convergence routing.

→ Load **[session-loop.md](session-loop.md)** and follow its conversation process.

---

## C. Topic Awareness

When a concern surfaces that belongs to a *different* topic — raised in conversation, not yet written into this file — flag it rather than letting it accumulate here. (Sustained *written* drift over multiple exchanges is the separate split signal — see **D. Convergence Routing**.)

**{concern}** belongs to a different topic, not this one.

**`r/reroute`** → Send it to the topic it belongs to; it picks it up later
**`k/keep`**    → Keep exploring here for now
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `reroute`:**

1. Identify the topic the concern belongs to. Read the live map:

   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-discovery/scripts/gateway.cjs {work_unit}
   ```

   Resolve the target, and judge `landing_phase` per **Judging the Landing Phase** in **[triage-landing.md](../../workflow-shared/references/triage-landing.md)**. If one topic clearly matches, propose it — with the recommended phase — and confirm with the user (their reply may override the phase). If nothing fits, propose a new kebab-case name and confirm. If several plausible candidates exist — or a near-match you're unsure of — present them and let the user choose:

   Write the candidates payload to `.workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/research/{topic}/reroute-candidates.json` with the Write tool (`{"concern": "…", "landing_phase": "…", "candidates": [{"name": "…", "lifecycle": "…"}]}` — every plausible home, lifecycle from the map read), then render it:

   ```bash
   node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs render reroute-candidates {work_unit}.research.{topic} --file .workflows/.cache/{work_unit}/research/{topic}/reroute-candidates.json
   ```

   Emit the call's MENU section verbatim per its marker.

   **STOP.** Wait for user response.

   A chosen candidate is the target; `new` means propose a kebab-case name and confirm it. A phase appended to the selection overrides `landing_phase`. If the resolved target is the current topic, it's not a reroute — fold it into this research file as a thread and → Return to **B. Session Loop**.

2. Record the concern with the full context discussed about it as `concern` — the target topic picks it up cold.

3. Load **[triage-landing.md](../../workflow-shared/references/triage-landing.md)** with work_unit = `{work_unit}`, target = `{target}`, concern = `{concern}`, origin = `{topic}`, phase = `research`, landing_phase = `{landing_phase}`, date = `{today}`. If `result` is `cancelled`, nothing landed — → Return to **B. Session Loop**. Otherwise the concern landed in `{landed_topic}`'s `{landing_phase}` triage queue — the delivery committed itself.

   **If the response carried `reconcile_flagged` or `sources_staled`:** also tell the user what the landing flagged — on a research landing, `{landed_topic}`'s completed discussion (to reconcile against the reopened research); on a discussion landing, the specification(s) named in `sources_staled`, whose extraction of `{landed_topic}` is now stale.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

**If `keep`:**

Keep exploring here. If written material keeps accumulating off-topic over multiple exchanges, the split path in **D. Convergence Routing** moves it out.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

---

## D. Convergence Routing

When you notice convergence signals (from the research guidelines), flag it and route to the appropriate action:

#### If sustained off-topic content has accumulated over multiple exchanges in this session

The current file is drifting — multiple exchanges have been adding material that doesn't belong under this topic's name. This is the trigger to split, not a clean thematic separation alone.

→ Load **[topic-splitting.md](topic-splitting.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If the current topic is converging (tradeoffs clear, approaching decision territory) or the user indicates they're done

→ Proceed to **E. In-Flight Agent Handling**.

---

## E. In-Flight Agent Handling

Before concluding, check for in-flight agents — run `node .claude/skills/workflow-engine/scripts/engine.cjs agent scan {work_unit} research {topic}` and read the response's `in_flight` list (agents dispatched but not yet returned). An agent dispatched by an earlier session cannot still be running — each row's `created` timestamp tells you which those are; close each (`agent incorporate`), re-scan, and count only this session's.

#### If no agents are in flight

→ Load **[topic-completion.md](topic-completion.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

#### If agents are still running

**`◆ There are still {N} background agents working.`**

**`w/wait`**    → Wait for results before concluding
**`p/proceed`** → Conclude now (results will persist in cache for reference)
```

**STOP.** Wait for user response.

**If `wait`:**

Watch for `agent scan` to promote each in-flight row to `pending`. When none remain in flight, delegate surfacing to the shared protocol loaded by review-agent.md and deep-dive-agent.md. The protocol applies the never-dump rules: two-phase surfacing, one finding at a time. Treat the current moment as a natural break — we are at phase conclusion, so the break check will pass.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.

**If `proceed`:**

→ Load **[topic-completion.md](topic-completion.md)** and follow its instructions as written.

→ Return to **B. Session Loop**.
